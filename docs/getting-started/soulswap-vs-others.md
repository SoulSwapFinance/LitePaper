:::tip
SoulSwap aims to be substantial improvement over using existing decentralized exchange protocols by enable a strategic alliance across multiple blockchains as an innovator in the field optimizing incentives-structures and enchanting forces at play.

We, the Cofounders of Soul Protocol, have set ourselves apart from the competition through our indisputable resolve and composure under even the most trying of times.

When it comes down to the aspects that make an 'okay' project a memorable one, one thing that always keep a community strong is the passion they can't help but feel when they hear from those who have organically found themselves in leadership positions, such as our moderators who were selected based off their knowledge and genuine passion for Soul.

 of the project or the Competitors on Fantom and Us when it comes down to our core defi products, our transparency, composability,  and maintainability, easy of use, bundle size, and upgrades and patches.

| **Compatibility & maintainability** | Our smart contracts were designed with interoperability in mind and can thus run in any type of environment or network, meaning you only have to program your them once, saving us our most valuable resource -- time. | Existing protocol liquidity incentives may only usewhat is minted on just a 
SINGLE blockchain. This is because if they choose to mint rewards on more than one blockchain at a time, then they will inevitably cause a hike, or increase, in their emissions rate, thereby violating the emissions rate, oftentimes provided to investers. These proverbial 'whales' would then be expected to hold onto shares that are proatively being dilutted away in a foreign ecosystem. This form of dilution occurs when emission rates exceed what was originally conveyed to the parties of interest, especially those who stand to lose from a sudden and arguably unethical detachment from a core aspect of a protocol - that is to say perhaps the strongest predictor of price expectations given the inherent dependent relationship between *emissions rate* and *circulating supply*.

Branch out to new blockchains requires writing and maintaining an entirely new set of solutions to resolve the inability to provide an intuitive, no non-sense interface and product that farmers already know and love?                                    
| **Bundle size**                     | Adding new wrappers to your dapp does now increase its size. This is because wrappers are downloaded at _runtime_ from a decentralized endpoint like IPFS. | JavaScript SDKs are installed using `npm`, which will increasing your dapp's bundle size.                                                                                      |
| **Upgrades & patches**              | Since wrappers are resolved at runtime, this allows for _optional_ automatic updates if the dapp is querying an updatable URI (such as an "ENS" domain).   | Since JS SDKs are bundled into applications, when new patches or features are released, the application must be rebuilt with the latest version. If breaking backend (smart contract) upgrades are performed, this would render the application broken until you rebuild with the latest SDK. |
