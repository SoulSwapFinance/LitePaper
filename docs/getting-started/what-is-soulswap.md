title: What is SoulSwap?
---

Summoning from the shrouds of Fantom, **Soul Protocol** emerges. A fully-decentralized ecosystem that has enabled cross-chain incentives *without* increasing the emission rate.

>SoulSwap is in **pre-alpha**, meaning our code and documentation are **rapidly changing**.

We anticipate our approach will provide us with the agility required of a community-driven, grassroots protocol in order to remain *relevant* in the fast-paced and competitive atmosphere of blockchain development.

## Our Roots and Inspiration

The **Soul Protocol** takes from the lessons learned by projects such as SushiSwap, Uniswap, Compound, and Pancakeswap and employs a hybridized protocol rewards ecosystem that eliminates the identified bugs, occassional mishaps, inefficiencies and near misses.

We have managed to successfully arrive at a mathematically-rigorous, sustainable ecosystem composed of 3 tokens bound together, each playing a unique counter-balancing force on another in order to maintain free-market-induced homeostasis.

These forces were carefully selected in order to incentivize bringing about subsequent market conditions that dissatisfy the nature equalibrium, resulting in near-frictionless corrections to resolve, which, in turn, smoothens out protocol inefficiencies in an effortless and natural manner that play to the forces of the market -- not against it.

We hold true the following precepts: giving something for nothing render you something to nothing and (2) always work with flow, never against. No one agent can outpower the matrix, so we work within the bounds of pragmatism with an emphasis on efficiency as we understand this to be the way. 

>When nature speaks, *we listen.*

## Our Founders and Vision

This `hybrid approach` is the brainchild of our cofounders, both of whom bring about their own relative strengths to the Protocol and together cover a wide set of skills required to successfully lead a protocol of our nature into a decentralized future in a sustainable and - just as important - senseble manner. This

Our approach to resolving the weakpoints inherent in other protocols and improving upon them in a strategic manner, incorporates various strategies hypothesized by our resident economist and cofounder [**0xBuns**](https://twitter.com/0xBuns) along with fellow cofounder [**DeGatchi**](https://twitter.com/DeGatchi) who approaches these insights from the perspective of a trader. DeGatchi has successfully completed a number of courses on blockchain development and was a senior Solidity and Web3 developer for MakiSwap, along with former lead Solidity Developer of MakiSwap, 0xBuns. DeGatchi who has studies and practices technical analysis with public record of his successful "moon shot" calls on social media.
