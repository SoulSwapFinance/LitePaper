> We enable our community to use a traditional AMM exchange, post limit orders, optimize with a Meta-Aggregator, swap Cross-Chain, and access an embedded Bridge (powered by [Multichain](https://multichain.org)).

## How to Swap
Select the currencies you are swapping. In our case, we will be swapping our FTM for SOUL.
Input the amount as the amount of currency you want to exchange FROM.

1. **Input Amount (from)**: this is the amount of the FROM currency to be exchanged.
2. **Output Amount (to)**: this is the amount of the TO currency expected in return for the given FROM amount.
3. **Note: Transaction Details**: price, minimum received, price impact, and liquidity provider fee).
4. **Use Aggregator (optional)**: enables us to proceed with our transaction, however using our Aggregator, which finds the optimal price for a given asset, thanks to the power of our Meta-Aggregator.

*Note: Users like yourself are also swapping, in real time, which causes the value of each currency in the pair to update.*

**Congratulations, you now own SoulPower -- take a bow!**
