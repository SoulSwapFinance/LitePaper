> This is our farms view. SoulPower is farmed by our liquidity providers as they provide the lifeblood of the Soul Ecosystem. We've designed a way to provide rewards to our summoners while minimizing instability.

## Overview
Providing liquidity is simplified by our sleek, user-friendly interface where end users may provide liquidity in a decentralized manner to our community-owned exchange.

**1 Select Farm**: the Farm pair or lending market for which you would like to deposit.

**2A Create LP or Lend Assets (optional)**: If you have not yet created the requested deposit token (LP or Lend), then you will be prompted to create prior to depositing.

**2B Zap into Assets (optional)**: For those interested in "Zapping" directly into an LP position, you may select "Zap" and select any asset to convert into the LP of your choosing.

**2C Approve Deposit (where applicable)**: Enter any amount and select this approve (if applicable) to allow the contract to deposit.
