> This is our farms view. SoulPower is farmed by our liquidity providers as they provide the lifeblood of the Soul Ecosystem. We've designed a way to provide rewards to our summoners while minimizing instability.

## Overview
Providing liquidity is simplified by our sleek, user-friendly interface where end users may provide liquidity in a decentralized manner to our community-owned exchange.

## How to Farm: Step-by-Step

**1**. Navigate to our Pools tab and select "Add Liquidity".

**2**. Navigate to Summoner: found here and select your desired pool to open the detailed view.Connect: make sure you're connect by using the "Connect Wallet" option at the top right.

**3**. Approve Stake: enter any amount and select this button to allow the contract to stake.Enter Amount: enter the amount of the LP to stake or use "MAX" to enter your entire balance.

**4**. Click 'Stake' Button: this button confirms your stake amount and accept the potential withdrawal fee, in the event that you withdraw within a 14-day timeframe. After this timeframe, your fee will reduce to 0% of your staked LP tokens.
