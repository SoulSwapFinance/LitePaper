Summoning from the shrouds -- **Soul Protocol** emerges! A fully-decentralized ecosystem that has enabled cross-chain incentives *without* increasing the emission rate. We anticipate our approach will provide us with the **agility required of a community-driven, grassroots protocol** in order to remain *relevant* in the fast-paced and competitive atmosphere of blockchain development. **Read more to learn about our founders, roots and inspiration, and our path ahead...**

## Our Roots and Inspiration

The **Soul Protocol** takes from the lessons learned by projects such as SushiSwap, Uniswap, Compound, and Pancakeswap and employs a hybridized protocol rewards ecosystem that eliminates the identified bugs, occassional mishaps, inefficiencies and near misses.

We have managed to successfully arrive at a mathematically-rigorous, sustainable ecosystem composed of 3 tokens bound together, each playing a unique counter-balancing force on another in order to maintain free-market-induced homeostasis.

These forces were carefully selected in order to incentivize bringing about subsequent market conditions that dissatisfy the nature equalibrium, resulting in near-frictionless corrections to resolve, which, in turn, smoothens out protocol inefficiencies in an effortless and natural manner that play to the forces of the market -- not against it.

We hold true the following precepts: giving something for nothing render you something to nothing and (2) always work with flow, never against. No one agent can outpower the matrix, so we work within the bounds of pragmatism with an emphasis on efficiency as we understand this to be the way. 

>When nature speaks, *we listen.*

### The Dream?
Decentralized powerhouse with interoperability ingrained from the very start. We have taken bits and pieces of what has worked for other projects that will never be able to do what we can do, thanks to the gift of hindsight. We plan to channel only the best of the best into our ecosystem. Now, allow us to convince you how we achieve this and why we are different from those that come before us.

## Our Founders and Vision

Our **hybrid approach** is the brainchild of our cofounders, both of whom bring about relative strengths to the Protocol and together cover a wide set of skills required to successfully lead a protocol of our nature into a decentralized future in a sustainable and - just as important - senseble manner. This

Our approach to resolving the weakpoints inherent in other protocols and improving upon them in a strategic manner, incorporates various strategies hypothesized by our resident economist and cofounder [**0xBuns**](https://twitter.com/0xBuns) along with fellow cofounder [**DeGatchi**](https://twitter.com/DeGatchi) who approaches these insights from the perspective of a trader. DeGatchi has successfully completed a number of courses on blockchain development and was a senior Solidity and Web3 developer for MakiSwap, along with former lead Solidity Developer of MakiSwap, 0xBuns. DeGatchi who has studies and practices technical analysis with public record of his successful "moon shot" calls on social media.

### Why Fantom?
It's a no brainer! In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While Fantom might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Fantom's ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. Sure, launching on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and probably receive faster initial uptake, but we like a challenge and are betting on Fantom's future.
Faster, cheaper, more resilient? Sold.


### Why Avalanche?
Our community proposed and [passed a proposal](https://enchant.soulswap.finance/#/proposal/0xac2f97c980156967f4be369f406e0b5fb65c18d22ce0320f3950a18a7c5bace7) to allocate 40% of our emissions over to Avalanche and we chose this as a strategic move for a number of reasons, checkout the full post in our [Forum](https://forum.soulswap.finance/t/enable-reward-incentives-on-avalanche/253/10).

### How We're Different
We’re here to build upon the work of the likes of Uniswap, SushiSwap, and PancakeSwap. We respect these protocol so much, in fact, we replicated their work from the ground up. 

We improved upon Uniswap's governance model, adopted incentives from Sushi and Pancake, while eliminating the oligarchy inherent in the UNI's governance model, and the static, one-dimensional rewards mechanism inherent in Sushi and Pancake.

We **eliminate the smart contract bug** tied to emergency withdrawal and thereby liberate the ingenius Syrup model PancakeSwap invented, though no longer able to utilize, whilst adding a dynamic rewards structure enabling rewards distribution to exist on multiple blockchains without increasing inflation. 

**What does that mean exactly?** We’re pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance with a focus on gamification and future-proofing our tech with elements right out the minds of blockchain developers, marketing experts, economists, front-end web3 developers, and some friends with deep pockets who know what we are capable of achieving and are eager to show their support.
