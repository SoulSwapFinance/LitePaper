## Our Roots and Inspiration

The **Soul Protocol** takes from the lessons learned by projects such as SushiSwap, Uniswap, Compound, and Pancakeswap and employs a hybridized protocol rewards ecosystem that eliminates the identified bugs, occassional mishaps, inefficiencies and near misses.

We have managed to successfully arrive at a mathematically-rigorous, sustainable ecosystem composed of 3 tokens bound together, each playing a unique counter-balancing force on another in order to maintain free-market-induced homeostasis.

These forces were carefully selected in order to incentivize bringing about subsequent market conditions that dissatisfy the nature equalibrium, resulting in near-frictionless corrections to resolve, which, in turn, smoothens out protocol inefficiencies in an effortless and natural manner that play to the forces of the market -- not against it.

We hold true the following precepts: giving something for nothing render you something to nothing and (2) always work with flow, never against. No one agent can outpower the matrix, so we work within the bounds of pragmatism with an emphasis on efficiency as we understand this to be the way. 

>When nature speaks, *we listen.*
