SoulSwap aims to be substantial improvement over using existing decentralized exchange protocols by enable a strategic alliance across multiple blockchains as an innovator in the field optimizing incentives-structures and enchanting forces at play. Below are just a few of our competitive edges that make us stand apart from our 

**THEIR PROBLEM**

When branching out to new blockchains, our competitor are required to write, maintain, and invent **an entirely new set of solutions** to resolve their inability to provide an intuitive, no non-sense interface and product that farmers already know and love. Reinvent the wheel each time a new chain is entered. 

Existing protocol liquidity incentives may only use what is minted on a SINGLE blockchain. This is because if they choose to mint rewards on more than one blockchain at a time, then they will inevitably cause a hike, or increase, in their emissions rate, thereby violating the emissions rate, oftentimes provided to investers. 

These proverbial 'whales' would then be expected to hold onto shares that are proatively being dilutted away in a foreign ecosystem. This form of dilution occurs when emission rates exceed what was originally conveyed to the parties of interest, especially those who stand to lose from a sudden and arguably unethical detachment from a core aspect of a protocol - that is to say perhaps the strongest predictor of price expectations given the inherent dependent relationship between *emissions rate* and *circulating supply*.

**OUR SOLUTION**

Our smart contracts were designed with interoperability in mind and can thus run in any type of environment or network, meaning you only have to program your them once, saving us time and keeping our product suite consistent across the board. We are built in a future-proof manner manner with interoperability build natively.
